#Group-Chat hyperty (work in progress)

##1. Group-Chat hyperty functionality description.
The Group-Chat hyperty allows to exchange chat messages amongst defined group of users. This hyperty has been developed as a App Hyperty. It means it is executed in the same sandbox as the main web application which uses it.
##1.1 Data schem used.
##2. Exposed API. 
##3. How to use it.
##4. Framework improvement proposals derived from Hyperty Group-Chat development.
When the Registry is checked to obtain the hyperties registered by a user only the last one was provided. So it was necessary to ask for to get the full list of hyperties registered for a user. (Maybe this may be moved to the Dev-Participate My City part).
