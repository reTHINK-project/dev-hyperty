Connector Hyperty
-------------

The Connector Hyperty main functionality is to handle two party audio and voice conversations by using WebRTC technology. Main features:

-- invite user for a WebRTC audio or video call

-- accept/reject invitation

-- have a cross domain video conversation with another peer eg

-- interoperability with SIP / IMS User Agents as well as with any reachable public E.164 enabled Mobile or Fixed phone.

This Hyperty handles standard [Connection Data Objects](../specs/datamodel/data-objects/connection).
[Live Demo Here]()*to be provided*.

## API

The Connector Hyperty implements two Hyperty APIs to be consumed by Applications:

-- the Hyperty Connector API manages the creation of new WebRTC connections;

-- the Hyperty ConnectionController API manages a certain WebRTC connection instance.

### Hyperty Connector API

The Hyperty Connector API is used to create new connections.

#### connect

This function is used to create a new connection providing the identifier of the user to be notified.

`<Promise> ConnectionController connect( URL.UserURL user, MediaStream stream, string ?name)`


**parameters**

*user* - user to be invited that is identified with reTHINK User URL.

*stream* - WebRTC local MediaStream retrieved by the Application

*name* - is a string to identify the connection.

**returns**

A ConnectionController object as a Promise.

**How to use it**

```javascript
  connector.connect(user, stream, name).then(function(controller){

  // your source code

  }).catch(function(reason) {
      console.error(reason);
  });
```


##### onInvitation (addEventListener)

This function is used to handle notifications about incoming requests to create a new connection.

`onInvitation(ConnectionController connection)`

**parameters**

*connection* - the ConnectionController to handle the incoming connection invitation.

**How to use it**

```javascript
connector.onInvitation(function(connection){...});
 ```

#### Hyperty ConnectionController API

The Hyperty ConnectionController API is used to control a connection instance.

##### accept

This function is used to accept an incoming connection request received by `connection.onInvitation()`.

`<Promise> boolean accept( MediaStream stream)`

**parameters**

*stream* - WebRTC local MediaStream retrieved by the Application

**returns**

It returns, as a Promise, `true` in case the connection is successfully accepted, `false` otherwise.

**How to use it**

```javascript
connection.accept(stream).then(function(accepted){

// your source code

}).catch(function(reason) {
    console.error(reason);
});
```


##### decline

This function is used to decline an incoming connection request received by `connection.onInvitation()`.

`<Promise> boolean decline(int ?reason)`

**parameters**

*reason* - Integer decline reason that is compliant with RFC7231. If not present `400` is used. (optional)

**returns**

It returns, as a Promise, `true` in case the connection is successfully declined, `false` otherwise.

**How to use it**

```javascript
connection.decline(reason).then(function(declined){

// your source code

}).catch(function(reason) {
    console.error(reason);
});
```

##### disconnect

This function is used to close an existing connection instance.

`<Promise> boolean disconnect()`

**returns**

It returns as a Promise `true` if successfully disconnected or `false` otherwise.

**How to use it**

```javascript
connection.close().then(function(closed){

// your source code

}).catch(function(reason) {
    console.error(reason);
});
```

##### onDisconnect

This function is used to receive requests to close an existing connection instance.

`onDisconect(DeleteEvent event)`

**parameters**

*event* - the DeleteEvent fired by the Syncher when the Connection is closed.

**How to use it**

```javascript
connection.onClose(function(event){...});
```

## Descriptor

The Hyperty Connector descriptor is:


```json
  "HypertyConnector": {
    "sourcePackage": {
      "sourceCode": ""
      "sourceCodeClassname": "HypertyConnector",
      "encoding": "base64",
      "signature": ""
      },
      "cguid": 10001,
      "hypertyType": [
      "audio",
      "video"
      ],
      "version": "0.1",
      "description": "Description of HypertyConnector",
      "objectName": "HypertyConnector",

          {
            "url": "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"
          },
          {
            "url": "turn:194.65.138.95:3478",
            "credential": "luis123",
            "username": "luis"
          }
        ]
      }
      },
      "constraints": {},
      "sourcePackageURL": "/sourcePackage",
      "language": "javascript",
      "signature": "",
      "messageSchemas": "",
      "dataObjects": [

      ],
      "accessControlPolicy": "somePolicy"
      }
```

The Hyperty Connector descriptor includes the required WebRTC ICE servers configuration:

```json
"configuration": {
"webrtc": {
  "iceServers": [
    {
      "url": "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"
    },
    {
      "url": "turn:194.65.138.95:3478",
      "credential": "luis123",
      "username": "luis"
    }
  ]
}
}
```

Since the Hyperty supports the standard connection data schema, any Catalog URL for that schema can be used.
