## Troubleshooting

### npm install fails on Windows with "EPERM, operation not permitted" error during rename

Open the node.js command prompt (Windows button => all programs => node.js => node.js command prompt => run as administrator)

### npm start fails

Check that port 443 is not blocked by other service or App e.g. Skype.

### Demos with Firefox: there is no Hyperty to select

Check your Firefox browser is updated.

### Demos: after selecting an Hyperty, there is no popup from google (to login, or verify access)

Check if there is any pop up blocker. Allow the popup and refresh.
